Hello! I'm Annafi Mirza, born and raised in Florida! I'm an undergraduate student
at the University of Miami doing a double major in Computer Science (w/ a focus in
cybersecurity) and Data Science & Artificial Intelligence.

Right now, I'm studying primarily Java and R and will eventually delve deeper into
Python, Assembly, and C. I also have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP
from developing websites as the lead developer of a coding group in high school. My
repositories contain projects exemplifying my skills in these languages.

I hope to become either an IT specialist or data engineer one day, depending on what
major I choose to stick with primarily. Watch as my projects evolve with me over time!
