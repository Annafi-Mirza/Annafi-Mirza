Born and raised in Florida! üêä

Currently working towards a double major in both Computer Science (Cryptography & Security Track) and Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, as well as a minor in Mathematics.

I am a part of the university‚Äôs Foote Fellows Honors program.

As shown in my projects, I am diving deep into Java for developing advanced solution-oriented programs, as well as Python, R, and their many libraries for developing and utilizing machine learning algorithms for training models.

I aspire to become a data engineer / scientist very soon in the Miami region!
